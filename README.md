  <p> People like to hear many different points of a conversation to give them a well-rounded
view of a situation. By providing additional points, you provide value to your audience. It’s
exactly what the media does to keep people engaged long enough to view and/or click
on an ad. </p>

  <p>The most important thing is to make sure the mobile user experience (UX) is robust. The
home pages I prefer, have a search bar, large image content container (LICC) for the
latest stories, trending posts and a store.
The search bar should auto populate blogs as the user types in their search query but
this is not mandatory. But you want the search bar to be clear and present - easy to find.
If someone wants to see if you wrote on a particular subject, they need to be able to easily
navigate to those blog posts.
The LICC is a personal favorite of mine because you can control what people see when
they first land on your page. You don’t want people randomly scrolling down your site
because often this leads to drop-offs - people leaving your site.
    I usually set this to chro</p>
  
  <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
  Video content doesn’t have to live on third-party platforms like YouTube. Post videos
directly to Twitter. For the same reason you post gifs and memes, you want to post videos
- they stand out on the timeline.
Videos autoplay (without sound) so your timeline comes alive. It’s animated. I see many
companies post links to their product promo videos on YouTube and get no a single like.
Their page looks dull!
How do you promote your YouTube/Vimeo/Twitch content on Twitter?
Take snippets, highlights of the video and upload them directly to Twitter. Then reply to
that tweet with a link to the video. If people expand the thread, they will see the full video
link. Your followers don’t have to expand it though. The entire thread will appear.
People are time conscious so you can hack their attention by doing this. They don’t want
to sit through a 10-minute YouTube video, but if you give them a taste, you can entice
them to.
The other reason you want to post videos on YouTube is psychological. Without them,
you’re just some anonymous account tweeting. You could be anybody.
But with videos, you verify and prove that you are who you say you are.
